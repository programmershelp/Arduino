

You can use the file from the write to SD card example. I created a new file called newtest.txt and entered the following data


new test example
1,2,3,4,5,6
Temp = 15c
Temp = 16c
Time = 09:39:20

There are some key things to keep in mind

You can have multiple files open at a time, and read from each one.
Read() only returns one byte at a time.
You should close() the file(s) when you're done

The simple sketch below will open the file created earlier

Code

#include <SD.h>
#include <SPI.h>

File testFile;
 
void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.print("Initializing SD card...");
   pinMode(10, OUTPUT);
 
  if (!SD.begin(10)) 
  {
    Serial.println("initialization failed!");
    return;
  }
  Serial.println("initialization complete.");
 
  // open the file
  testFile = SD.open("newtest.txt");
  if (testFile) 
  {
    Serial.println("newtest.txt:");
 
    //read from the file
    while (testFile.available()) 
    {
      Serial.write(testFile.read());
    }
    // close the file:
    testFile.close();
  } 
  else 
  {
    Serial.println("error opening newtest.txt");
  }
}
 
void loop()
{

}


Result

Open the serial monitor and you should see something like this


Initializing SD card...initialization complete.
newtest.txt:
new test example
1,2,3,4,5,6
Temp = 15c
Temp = 16c
Time = 09:39:20
